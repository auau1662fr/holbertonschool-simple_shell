Simple Shell
Description

Simple Shell is a minimal UNIX command-line interpreter written in C.
It reproduces the core behavior of the standard /bin/sh shell, allowing users
to execute commands in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

This project focuses on understanding process creation, system calls,
environment variables, and command execution in a UNIX environment.

Features

Interactive mode with custom prompt ($)

Non-interactive mode (input via pipe or file)

Command execution using the PATH environment variable

Built-in commands:

exit — exits the shell

env — displays environment variables

Proper handling of Ctrl + C (SIGINT)

Error handling for invalid commands

Memory-safe (no memory leaks)

Compliant with Betty coding style

Usage
Compilation
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

interactive Mode
./hsh
($) ls
($) pwd
($) exit

Non-Interactive Mode
echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
cat file.txt | ./hsh
